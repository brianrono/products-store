   git clone https://github.com/brianrono/products-store.git
   cd products-store
2. **Install backend dependencies**:
npm install
3. *Install frontend dependencies*:
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
4. *Set up environment variables*: Create a .env file in the backend folder with the following values: 
   MONGO_URI=<your-mongo-uri>
   PORT=5000

---

### Running the Application
1. *Start the backend server*:
   npm run dev
2. *Start the frontend*:
   cd frontend
   npm start
3. *Access the application*: Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000

### Known Issues
- *Validation Errors*: Ensure all required fields are filled when creating or updating a product.
- *API Connectivity*: Ensure the backend server and MongoDB are running before accessing the app.

### Future Implements
- Add user authentication and role-based access control.
- Implement product search and filtering functionality.
- Add unit and integration tests for critical components and APIs.
